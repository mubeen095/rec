<p>Drive your team to perform better with Employee motivation.<strong> Drive your team to perform bette</strong>r by accelerating perks and benefits to employees. Career growth promised will Drive your team to perform better.</p>



<p>Employee motivation is one of the critical factors in
employee performance. Sometimes your workers lack satisfaction with what they
are doing, or they feel unhappy about the workplace culture. Then the chances
are that they would try and shun their responsibilities, do low quality work
and perform poorly.</p>



<p>So, to ensure excellent results and achievement of
goals, the company must ensure that its employees are highly motivated. The
source of motivation can be anything. It can be monetary, non-monetary or any
other personal factor. As a manager of a firm, finding the pulse of employees
is significant.</p>



<p><strong>Why is
employee motivation essential?</strong></p>



<p>If an employee is well-motivated, he or she can reach
their maximum potential. They can accomplish their personal goals and aim at
self-development, which leads to professional excellence. Once your employees
see a link between their efforts and outcomes, then they tend to deliver even
better.</p>



<p>The most common mistake an organisation makes is to
think that money is all that motivates an employee. But money is only one of
the most critical aspects. Money can&#8217;t alone make employees satisfied. Most
times business firms forget a list of other factors including, </p>



<ul><li>Recognising an employee for their performances is quite necessary. </li><li>Your goals for the firm should comprise the goals of your employee as well.</li></ul>

<p>Especially in the time of economic crisis, keeping
your employees encouraged should be your number one priority. You need to
remind your team members that they need to overcome the barriers of today’s
market and emerge successful on the other side. You have to try hard to keep
their confidence high and provide the best result. Acknowledge their efforts
and inform them that their support is needed for the company more now than
ever.</p>



<p>Consider yourself in the place of a captain whose ship is facing a big storm. You need to continuously inspire and motivate your crew members and give them proper support to overcome the situation. As a good leader, you should encourage your workforce, which will help them defeat their fears. You must be with them not only as their employer, but also as a leader, and friend. Above all, be with them as a philosopher!!</p>



<p><strong>How can professional motivational speakers help you to Drive your team to perform better?</strong></p>



<p>Most of the companies are hiring professional
motivational speakers nowadays. It will help the employers to get the most out
of their employees. And that is not at all a bad idea!</p>

undoubtedly help you to help your employees and keep them happy with your work
environment. </li><li>He will ensure that your employees

experiences. And setting out to search for another job can sometimes be a long,
arduous journey. It can be exhausting and upsetting, with physical and
psychological consequences. The effects of unemployment can even go hand in

It’s crucial to continue your hunt for a job. But it&#8217;s just as essential to building your self-worth.

<h2><strong>Five methods to help you decelerate your job search depression</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.bssrecruit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-emotional-stages-of-the-job-search-cartoon-infographic.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1168" width="585" height="486" srcset="https://www.bssrecruit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-emotional-stages-of-the-job-search-cartoon-infographic.jpg 794w, https://www.bssrecruit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-emotional-stages-of-the-job-search-cartoon-infographic-300x249.jpg 300w, https://www.bssrecruit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-emotional-stages-of-the-job-search-cartoon-infographic-768x638.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px" /></figure>



<ul><li><strong>Step
back and take a break</strong></li></ul>



<p>“Relax! You just lose your job. No one likes throwing
out from their position unless they hated in the first place. So, never look at
it as a failure or drown in self-pity and doubt. We know, it&#8217;s difficult to
turn a negative experience into a positive when you loved your job. Whether you
liked it or not, you&#8217;ve just got a mini-vacation now. More than likely, you
needed the rest before another start. Use the initial days to take inventory
and relax. Now, you have plenty of time to work around the clock. Watch a movie
with your children. Find something worth doing and enjoy the extra time off
from work.</p>



<p>Make a list of those things you extremely hate about
your previous job. Utilise the time to rant a little about those pesky
complaints to your friends. Vent about your boss&#8217;s absurdities. It may help you
break from the old job, avoid being unemployed and depressed and prepare to
move forward. Just avoid doing this on social media.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Don&#8217;t
get too cosy</strong></li></ul>



<p>Relaxing and learning to love or hate your old job is excellent. Just remember your career goals. Don&#8217;t get too comfy catching up on missed TV shows. Use your time wisely and efficiently. Just because the paycheck stopped arriving doesn&#8217;t mean you have no work to do. Consider your new life as a job. Set the alarm to wake you at the same time and get ready for action. Schedule your time for essential tasks and relaxation.</p>



<p>Prepare for the job hunt by polishing up your CV and
cover letter. Remove out-of-date items of the resume and update the template
and design adding a more modern and professional touch. </p>



<ul><li>Are there any skills, experience or
professional development missing?</li><li>Check whether you added your most
recent position? </li><li>Does your CV reflect a doer or an
achiever? </li></ul>



<p>Will these questions will make you prepared for the
job search. </p>



<ul><li><strong>Learn
to identify risk factors</strong></li></ul>



<p>Losing a job will be much like losing a loved one.
Many people grieve the loss of their career and then become angry and curse
their fate. Once they have worked through all the emotions, they pick up the
pieces and start moving on. Sometimes though, job loss depression sets in, and
it takes a little more pushing to move ahead. Learn to identify the triggers
and symptoms of depression. </p>



<ul><li>Are you a little moody? </li><li>How much are you sleeping daily? </li><li>Are you missing your meals? </li></ul>



<p>Changes in lifestyle are the most common signs of
depression</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>“When one door is closed, don’t you know that many more are open.” </em></p><cite> <em> Bob Marley</em> </cite></blockquote>



<ul><li><strong>Get
in shape</strong></li></ul>



<p>It is the perfect time to learn a new hobby or start
an exercise regimen as you have lo of spare time in your hands. Consider Active
leisure as a necessity you can&#8217;t live without. There many health benefits of
being active. It creates a sense of achievement, develops strong self-esteem
and turns downtime into valuable time.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Be
useful</strong></li></ul>



<p>Everyone in the world needs to feel useful. We need to
feel wanted and appreciated by others. That&#8217;s just human nature. It&#8217;s also why
self-esteem often is linked to our jobs and family life. When we go through
unemployment depression, we feel valued when others come to us for advice and
help. Take this notion and start helping others. Many stays at home, mothers
and fathers learned to become more involved in their children&#8217;s school
activities or local community events. They joined neighbourhood organizations,
local PTA boards and other organizations to feel needed.</p>



<p>It is great for the resume as well. Volunteering for
local events enhance leadership potential and develop communication skills.
Employers look for candidates who go the extra mile to help others. It shows
dedication and commitments, a valuable trait for any business. You should look
for local volunteer initiatives in your area. Non-profits always need help from
volunteers.</p>



<p>Depression, anxiety, and stress all play an essential role in how long a person is out of work. While much of this cannot get prevented, you can take steps to lower the chances of kicking out of a job long-term. Maintain a positive attitude always and don&#8217;t give up. There are more jobs out there. Trapping yourself into unemployment, depression and anxiety only prevents you from moving forward.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong><em>“</em></strong><em>One’s dignity may be assaulted, vandalized and cruelly mocked, but it can never be taken away unless it is surrendered.”</em></p><cite> <strong><em>Michael J. Fox</em></strong> </cite></blockquote>







<p>The term bullying may let you travel to your school
days where bullying was common. You may imagine the schoolyard bully abusing
another student verbally or physically hurting him. The reality is that
bullying doesn&#8217;t just occur in schools; it can happen anywhere, including
schools, in the workplace, or at home. </p>



<p>There are several keys to deal with bullies effectively. The most significant thing to remember is that you don&#8217;t have to tolerate abuse.</p>



<p><strong>What is
bullying?</strong></p>



<p>Bullying is a type of behaviour that is used by a
person or group of people intimidating or abusing others. It can be physically,
emotionally or any other kind of abuse where the person feels unsafe. While
bullying is never your fault, you don&#8217;t need to fear anything.</p>



<p>There are a lot of ways to Deal with bullies effectively. The essential thing you should keep in your mind is that you don&#8217;t have to tolerate abuse. Here are a few ways to  <strong><a href="https://www.bssrecruit.com/actionable-ways-to-deal-with-bullies-effectively/">Deal with bullies effectively.</a></strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>“If they don’t like you for being yourself, be yourself even more.”</em></p><cite> <strong><em>— Taylor Swift</em></strong> </cite></blockquote>



<h2 id="h-how-to-deal-with-bullies-effectively"><strong>How to deal with bullies effectively?</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.bssrecruit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bully-character-archetype.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1160" width="560" height="770" srcset="https://www.bssrecruit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bully-character-archetype.jpg 471w, https://www.bssrecruit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bully-character-archetype-218x300.jpg 218w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></figure>



<ul><li><strong>Walk
away</strong></li></ul>



<p>Don&#8217;t engage with a bully, if possible. Stay away from
the situation. Use your body language to display that you don&#8217;t care what
they&#8217;re doing.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Never
show yourself pathetic</strong></li></ul>



<p>If they are verbally abusive, think about something else.
Show that you are apathetic. It works as a defence for the bullies that target
others just to get a reaction from them. They will get defeated in the end when
you don&#8217;t give them what they want.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Learn
to say no</strong></li></ul>



<p>Yell the word &#8220;stop&#8221; and let the bully know
that you are not okay with what you are doing. If people are around, it shows
them that you are not afraid to speak up to them and bring attention to the
situation. You need not put up with it, so as long as you feel safe doing so,
let it be known.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Stay
positive</strong></li></ul>



<p>Stay positive at the moment. It will make you remember
that you are doing the best that you can. Their abuse can do nothing in your
life and career. Only you matter. You are someone that objectively has value
and this behaviour. What they are doing is about them, and it doesn&#8217;t say
anything about your worth.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>“People who repeatedly attack your confidence and self-esteem are quite aware of your potential, even if you are not.”</em></p><cite> <strong><em>— Wayne Gerard Trotman</em></strong> </cite></blockquote>



<ul><li><strong>Imagine
a shield protecting you. </strong></li></ul>



<p>Visualise a shield or force field that makes you feel
safer so that you don&#8217;t feel impacted by what they are saying. One of the
things that bullies are excellent at doing is making someone feel physically
unsafe, which can be a physical barrier.</p>



<p>Say something funny. Humour sometimes catches a bully
off guard. If you say something witty to a bully, they might be disarmed by
what you&#8217;re saying and not know how to respond.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Kill
them with kindness. </strong></li></ul>



<p>Similar to a display of apathy or humour, It
communicates that you are not here to take their abuse. Being kind to a person
who is being mean to you is a way to deflect the situation. It makes them feel
guilty for treating you poorly, and they stop bullying you.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Create
an army to combat the bullying. </strong></li></ul>



<p>Most of the times, bully target one person. They won&#8217;t
necessarily attack a group of people. If you and your friends stand up against
a bully together, they will be less likely to target an individual because they
get outnumbered.</p>



<p>Bullying is persistent and has the ability to cause
severe psychological damage to the afflicted person or group of people.
Bullying can occur among school-aged children or adults. The long-term effects
are the same: low self-respect, depression and even it lead to suicide.</p>



<p>If you are going through this situation, you should learn positive coping strategies to fight back against a bully. The above section will help you become more confident. It gives you a clear picture of how to handle a bully and what to do to support someone who is getting bullied.</p>

It is the fuel that allows common people to attain uncommon results.”  Andrew Carnegie </em></p></blockquote>



<p>Building a successful business is to build a capable work team of skilled people. Your team should be composed of individuals who are at the top of their field and can help you expand your business further. You will never be able to build a thriving business alone as it will be a collective effort. </p>



<p>Most of the organisations are recognising the
importance of team building and are trying to foster it in the workplace. So,
they are often pondering on the performance and relationships of their team
members. Performance indicators show that highly-efficient teams will almost
always outperform than people working individually. Whether it is in
high-pressure situations or when multiple skillsets are needed.</p>



<p>Once the team aspect gets injected into all of your
employees, your company will experience meticulous growth and success. If you
want to know how to construct a winning team, follow these seven rules of team
building </p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-build-a-capable-work-team"><strong>How to  build a capable work team</strong></h2>



<ul><li> <strong>Everybody should get focused on the same goals.</strong></li></ul>



<p>No one person in your workforce is greater than the
team. If your employees follow his/ her agenda as their selfishness can
negatively affect the performance of the entire team. If every man works
according to their wish, you will have a dysfunctional team, which prevent you
from achieving your goals. So, as a team leader, it is your responsibility to
recognize this behaviour so that you can rectify it instantly. You do not
require personal pursuits to spoil the team structure that you have worked hard
to frame.</p>



<p>Set goals for your firm and set the benchmarks that
each individual on your team should reach so that you can accomplish the stated
goals. It is how you get everyone in your organization to work on the same
page. You are the leader, the commander of the ship – but your business will go
only as far as your team’s performance allows.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Make
winning the priority.</strong></li></ul>



<p>No matter which position each individual on your team
is in — winning should be your team’s foremost priority because that helps keep
everyone on track. When each individual knows the expectations and goals, they
will be more productive and effective with their actions. Set goals for each team
member to accomplish on an individual level and ensure their individual
performance aligns with other team members. With this attitude, winning becomes
easier for your team.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Instil
a committed work ethic.</strong></li></ul>



<p>Even if you have very skilled individuals on your team,
that amounts to nothing if they do not believe in working hard consistently. </p>



<p>Laziness leads to adverse results and in return, a
feeble business. Hard work is required for all companies, no matter the size.
Every member on your team requires to be dedicated and passionate about the
vision of your organization. </p>



<ul><li><strong>Establish
the importance of communication.</strong></li></ul>



<p>The teams that succeed are those that know how to
collaborate well and have excellent communication. No matter how well outlined
no strategy can be executed upon if the conversation is not happening. </p>



<p>As a team leader, you will have to enforce the
importance of excellent communication. Make it a necessity for your team
members to constantly be in conversation with one another. Every person needs
to apprehend their role and how they can support other team members to achieve
their goals. This mind-set is what drives to excellent team chemistry and
performance.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong><em>“Interdependent people combine their own efforts with the efforts of others to achieve their greatest success.” </em></strong></p><cite> <strong><em>— Stephen Covey</em></strong> </cite></blockquote>



<ul><li><strong>Look
for the best talent.</strong></li></ul>



<p>Your company’s progress is reliant on the culture you
have chosen to establish. If you do not build a fun but disciplined culture,
you will be running a zoo instead of a business. You have to outline roles and
responsibilities, as well as recognise the right skills and people that fit
those roles. </p>



<p>Never be hesitant to hire people who are more
intelligent than you. Their strength to get things done is how you will become
the supervisor of a thriving business. Sell the potential hires on your vision
so that they will be excited to join your team. The best and most eminent are
going to be tempted if it is a good vision, if they can feel your passion, and
if you can clearly connect the execution plan.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Sell
the vision to inspire passion.</strong></li></ul>



<p>As a leader, you should establish the vision,
construct the goals, and motivate your team members to rally around the
mission. Everybody should want to touch victory not only for themselves but
also for the entire team. The companies that fail are those who do not energize
their employees and making them feel like an expendable piece. Communicate to
each member how their role adds to the overall achievements of the whole team.
Having them understand that they are efficient too for the success of the other
team members drives them to put their best effort forward all the time. They
become committed to the vision, which is exactly what you want for continued
success.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Apply a coach’s mindset to your leadership.</strong></li></ul>



<p>We make teams with individuals with specialized skills. Each individual understands the requirements from them and works to produce the expected results. As a leader, you are the coach who studies and analyzes each member of your team to know how to place them in the right position. You have to help manage their performances so that they can perform to the best of their capabilities. Know each member of your team better than they know themselves. When you understand their strengths and weaknesses, you know what works for them and what does not.</p>



<p>Team building is one of the most mattering
responsibilities a manager has. It isn’t something that can be performed in a
short time and then neglected. It is an on-going organic process that you will
have to facilitate and guide. As this process unfolds, your team members will
begin to trust and support one another and share their skill sets and effort to
more effectively complete your organisation’s goals.</p>

<p>The executive search firm is a recruiting partner for its clients, assisting in the hiring process.</p>



<p>A bad hire in a C-suit position can cause disastrous consequences in a business firm. So it is highly essential for the firms to find qualified, top-performing executives. But the search for the right candidate can make the process far longer and far more stringent. </p>



<p>The cost of not filling an executive job role can
cause negative ramifications on the success of your firm and the well-being of
an entire department. Do you still want to take the risk of resorting to quick,
low-cost alternatives like scouring LinkedIn, posting a job ad, or hiring a
contingency recruiter?</p>



<p>If you’re rummaging through all your options, here are
the reasons why top executive search firms can worth the investment when it
comes to finding the ideal talent for your most senior positions. </p>



<p><strong>What is an
executive search firm?</strong></p>



<p>Head-hunters or an executive search firm is a recruitment company that specialises in sourcing high-quality candidates for executive roles. We work exclusively with our client, taking the time to analyse the existing talent within the company and to understand the company culture and facets of the position. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.bssrecruit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/b8d02f87230eed5dfa19b6f7f8628804.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1138" width="575" height="575" srcset="https://www.bssrecruit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/b8d02f87230eed5dfa19b6f7f8628804.jpg 500w, https://www.bssrecruit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/b8d02f87230eed5dfa19b6f7f8628804-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.bssrecruit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/b8d02f87230eed5dfa19b6f7f8628804-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 575px) 100vw, 575px" /></figure>



<h2><strong>Why work with a top-notch executive search firm?</strong></h2>



<ul><li><strong>Access
to a network of high-quality executive professionals</strong></li></ul>



<p>If you have blown through your referrals list and network
connections and still aren’t able to pick out the qualified executive candidate
that ticks all the boxes, it may be time to call in an executive search firm.</p>



<p>Most of the leading executive search firms have a
global network of contacts across various industries. It means that the pool of
talent they have access to is far more extensive, far more exclusive and of a
considerably higher quality.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Some
job positions are too important not to invest in</strong></li></ul>



<p>The consequence of a bad hire can lead your company to
a huge loss. Top retained search firms are well-practised in understanding the
rare skills mix needed for a C-suite position and can quickly identify the
right fit.</p>



<ul><li><strong>You
don’t have the in-house resources.</strong></li></ul>



<p>Assessing candidate CVs takes time. If you scan-read, you
may lose some of the more intricate details as you don’t get enough time to go
through them properly. As executive search firms deal with CV assessment every
day, we know what to look for in a powerful CV, including hard skills, soft
skills and personality.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Fill
the gap of knowledge and gain better diversity</strong></li></ul>



<p>If you are recruiting for a newly created position or
isn’t within your area of expertise, top head-hunters have the specialist
skills to help fill that knowledge gap.</p>



<ul><li><strong>You
want long-term employees</strong></li></ul>



<p>Unlike a contingency recruiting firm, who consider a
recruited employee as a success, retained executive search agencies calculate
success based on the contribution and longevity of their employees.</p>



<p>Most of the candidates may have the necessary skills
on paper. Still, an executive firm will be able to tell you which applicant has
the right talent for long-term success and will eventually contribute to the
future growth of the business.</p>



<ul><li><strong>When
discretion is paramount</strong></li></ul>



<p>There are occasions in which you need ultimate
discretion, such as hiring a substitution when a senior executive is still in
the job role. By outsourcing the task, you are relieved of workplace secrecy
but yet have all the control, trust and transparency of having the task taken
care of by someone impartial.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Never
damage relationships with partner companies or competitors</strong></li></ul>



<p>Hiring through an executive search firm is an
excellent way to avoid damaging relations with the clients you often work with
or causing tension with a competitor. Recruiting from the same pool of talent
becomes far less complicated when working through a discreet, impartial third
party.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Succession
planning to future-proof your C-suite</strong></li></ul>



<p>Being prepared for every event is crucial for the
stability of the business. Unexpected resignations of senior-level employees
can cause unwanted disruption within teams and hinder how successful you are at
reaching your goals.</p>



<p>Hiring a head-hunter to come in and analyse your
workforce is a reliable way to get a clear picture of the in-house talent you already
have. It also lets you know which options are available to you externally.</p>



<p>Working with the right executive search firm can save your time maximise your profit. It can have a profoundly positive impact on your company in the long run. Your Retained Executive Search partner will actively seek out the best talent for your opportunity, engage them, and bring you, multiple candidates, to choose from.</p>

<p>Resolve your workplace woes is the most professional manner rather than ostracising the woes address it and erase them for better productivity in the concern,</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.bssrecruit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/41yO2qYxd1L.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1120" width="576" height="661" srcset="https://www.bssrecruit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/41yO2qYxd1L.jpg 378w, https://www.bssrecruit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/41yO2qYxd1L-261x300.jpg 261w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /></figure>



<p>Issues aren’t uncommon in the workplace. Every day we
undergo several problems, which may be related to your work, co-workers,
resources, policies, etc. </p>



<ul><li>So, what exactly will you do when
you disagree with company policy or need to register a formal complaint about
your annoying co-worker? </li><li>And what do you do when your
manager turns his back to your complaint? </li></ul>



<p>Trust me when I say that managing complaints is not at
the top of any manager’s list of favourites things to do — especially on-going
charges which can wear down even the best manager. </p>



<p>Sometimes your manager ignores your complaint. But, it
will not make them disappear, and it could negatively affect the productivity
and morale of an employee or the entire team. The outcome can make a
disgruntled employee and a manager who no longer engage the employees. It can
also create an intolerable situation for the remaining people in the office who
are enduring the negative.</p>



<p>Are you facing the same issues? Then this will be the
end of the problem, and you can enjoy a tension-free workplace. Now, let us
look at how to resolve your office woes the professional way. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>People will forget what you said, they will forget what you did, but they will never forget how you made them feel.</em></p><cite> <strong><em>Maya Angelou</em></strong> </cite></blockquote>

<h2><strong>How to resolve your  Resolve your workplace woes the professional way?</strong></h2>



<ul><li><strong>Turn
complaints into requests</strong></li></ul>



<p>Talking directly to the supervisor is the first step to take when trying to  <strong><a href="https://www.bssrecruit.com/resolve-your-workplace-woes/">Resolve your workplace woes</a></strong>. Even though you haven’t any past experiences to bring feedback to your manager, it is always the ideal way to start addressing your concerns. But, before actually going into listing your complaint, take a moment and think numerous times about what you want to happen. </p>



<p>If you want a positive approach from your manager, you
need to convert your complaint to requests. Then you’re moulding a path instead
of staying stuck in the mud and expecting someone else to get you out.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Identify
the solution ahead of time</strong></li></ul>



<p>Getting prepared with ideal solutions is the best
thing to do when you walk to your manager’s office. If you enter into your
manager&#8217;s cabin with a long list of complaints and no proactive steps to take
to resolve them, you’ll end up sounding like a complainer. So take some time
and get a clear picture of what the complaints are, why they upset you, and
what is the ideal solution to the problem would be.&nbsp; It will allow you to be precise with your
concerns and also help your supervisor better understand how to assist you.
Your employer may not be able to make the change happen, but they will never
know what you’re hoping to see if you don’t tell them.</p>



<ul><li><strong>When
to take the complaint above your boss</strong></li></ul>



<p>If you find your manager unable to help you with the
situation, or nothing gets resolved after you made the complaint, what steps
are going to take? Try taking the complaint request to the person’s boss or
your manager’s supervisor. Even then, the issues continue to be ignored or
unresolved; you can go to human resources.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Make
an agreement with your boss</strong></li></ul>



<p>If you want to make sure your complaint gets the
attention you feel it deserves, the ideal way to keep this conversation
professional and between you and your manager is to agree on how to handle the
situation best.</p>



<p>When you approach your supervisor with your request,
ask him if they will agree to look at it and get back to you. Agreements are
far better than expectations as they represent a dialogue, where expectations
are just something we place on a person whether they want it or not.</p>



<p>If your supervisor agrees to look into your request,
ensure you ask for a date that you both can agree for resolving the issue. But,
if it’s a more serious problem, such as sexual harassment or illegal actions,
you will want to have this fixed within a shorter period, if not immediately.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Don’t
Be Afraid to Issue a Complaint </strong></li></ul>



<p>Though making a complaint at the workplace can feel
intimidating, professionally approaching the issue will help you resolve.</p>



<p>The most significant difference between a complaint
and constructive feedback is that the latter is solution-oriented. Everybody
wants to vent now and then, but ensure that the person you’re complaining to be
the right person. </p>



<p>Let your small frustrations about scheduling, slightly annoying co-workers or not-so-fun tasks out during conversations with friends and family, never share it with your boss. If you have a bigger problem to address, don’t be shy about discussing it with your manager as you both are here to make your team better!</p>

<p>Life
is a mixture of rising and falling like the two sides of the same coin.
Sometimes, you get head and sometimes the tail. No matter how driven or
talented a person may be, we all face difficulties in our careers. </p>



<p>You
may face a series of tough days, rough months and major setbacks when
everything goes wrong simultaneously. It can be because of your key client
walks away, your boss puts you down, and your presentation is a failure or any
other reason. </p>



<p>But
it is in those moments we need little more support and guidance to find more
opportunity for growth. When you can enhance your ability to navigate the
difficult times, you not only live a happier life, but you also grow as a
person. </p>

<h2>How to manage your Tough times in career  </h2>



<p><strong>Stay positive</strong></p>



<p>You
need to fill your heart with positive thoughts to fight with your tough days.
When you stay positive, you’re placing yourself in the best position possible
to not only make it through those difficult times but become a better person in
the process.</p>



<p>You can undertake one of two things when life takes a turn for the worst. You can stay positive and remind yourself that there is a light at the end of the tunnel and that you will make it through, or you can curl up in the fetal position and relegate yourself for being nothing more than a victim of circumstance.</p>



<p>Everyone
goes through bad moments. But instead of considering your life fall upside
down, pick up the pieces eventually and start moving forward. </p>



<ul><li><strong>Get Creative</strong></li></ul>



<p>There
are a lot of times you can’t do much to change your situation. You have to deal
with it. But there are a few other times when you can actively work to make the
situation better.</p>



<p>You
may not see the solution in plain sight, because if it were you probably
wouldn’t have stepped into that situation in the first place. But if you can
take a few steps back and see the bigger picture, you may discover something
that can help you.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Learn from your
difficulties</strong></li></ul>



<p>When you find yourself amidst a Tough time in career, pick everything apart and see what went wrong and what you could’ve done differently to avoid this situation. It will end you up learning something that helps you and eventually gets a visible picture of what you need to do to ensure that you will not fall in the same situation again. Or if you find yourself in a related situation, you will get to know what to do to minimise the difficulty of the case. It’s more comfortable getting through a difficult time when you know the chances of it happening again are slim to none.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Change It Up</strong></li></ul>



<p>Once
you identify the key takeaways from your difficult time, you need to make a
change. It will help you stay away from stressful situations like this. If it’s
something that you can’t execute right now, take note of it so you can use it
when you ever get into similar circumstances.</p>



<p>Welcome
all the difficulties and struggles that life hands you wholeheartedly because
there’s a silver lining in each one of them. You’re a lot stronger than you
give yourself credit for.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Realize You’ve Come a Long
Way</strong></li></ul>



<p>Sometimes
we get so focused on the roadway ahead, that we never look back to see what
we’ve already travelled. Give yourself credit for everything you have already
done. Then you will give yourself a confidence boost when you realise that
you’ve already made so much</p>



<ul><li><strong>Build Up Your Community</strong></li></ul>



<p>Having
the right people around you is an important thing you can do for yourself when
the times get tough. Surround yourself with people who love, care, honest. And
you need them to be available for you. When you pick up your phone looking for
some compassion or honesty, it helps to have someone who’s going to answer.</p>



<p>You
need someone honest and can look you in the eye tell you the truth. Their
honesty maybe that one piece of information you need to get through the tough
time. </p>



<p>Building a strong relationship with people who can offer you their shoulder to lean on can understands what it is that you’re going through. They also can relate to your situation. If you can find people who have been through what you’re going through, you can find out how they made it and then put in that to your own life. </p>



<p>Naturally, upsetting events like layoffs or difficult managers can make you wary as you move forward. By using these strategies, you’re taking significant steps to improve the quality of your work life significantly.</p>

When the employees of a firm work with a team mentality, each filling a needed role and fulfilling long-term goals, the company operates powerfully with most longevity and success. </p>



<p><strong>What is a team?</strong></p>



<p>A
team is a group of employees who unite around for doing a particular task;
project or objective interdependently. Developing a successful work team can be
tough and challenging because </p>



<ul><li>It brings together a variety of opinions and values, </li><li>Past work experiences, </li><li>Upbringings, </li><li>Prior team experiences, </li><li>Work goals, </li><li>Skills in communication and team building.</li></ul>



<p>What
can you do to ensure your team is durable and perfect for your company? Jump to
our top five critical steps given below, which surely help you build a strong
and successful work team. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>&#8220;The strength of the team is each individual member. The strength of each member is the team.&#8221; </em></p><cite> <strong><em> Phil Jackson</em></strong> </cite></blockquote>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="739" height="415" src="https://www.bssrecruit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1098" srcset="https://www.bssrecruit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-2.jpg 739w, https://www.bssrecruit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-2-300x168.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px" /></figure>



<h2><strong>How to build a strong and Successful Teamwork </strong></h2>



<ul><li><strong>Spend more time for
recruiting your team members</strong></li></ul>



<p>A
thorough selection process is essential for picking the right team members and
get long-term benefits. You need someone happy to work for you rather than
someone who has only their body in the workspace. It also winds up costing you
more money in the long run. </p>



<p>When
a passionate candidate enters into your team, he will collaborate with others
quickly and spread his knowledge. He finds creative solutions and encourages
others to hunt down success. </p>



<ul><li><strong>Value each role</strong></li></ul>



<p>You
need to treat each job role as an essential part of your operation and let each
individual bring something special on the table. Give proper feedback to their
views and opinion, which help him improve his performance. </p>



<p>If
your employees feel that their role is undervalued or perhaps unnecessary, it
leads them to check out mentally. Then, work becomes mechanical for them,
something they detach entirely from as soon as the day is over.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Communication</strong></li></ul>



<p>Communication
is the best to demonstrate value between team members. Success will fall on
your way when your team members share work information and climb the mountain
together. If employees are poles apart, and they refuse to share what they are
working on, they never able to become a powerful work team. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>&#8220;Talent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence win championships.&#8221; </em></p><cite> <strong><em>Michael Jordan</em></strong> </cite></blockquote>







<ul><li><strong>Set goals</strong></li></ul>



<p>Setting
short-term and long-term goals with your team is vital as it becomes the
foundation for the tasks they set out to complete each day. It will make your
team become enthusiastic about the outcome and motivate each other with
positive reinforcement. Knowing why each task they do is necessary for
accomplishing a longer-term goal will help them ensure that they work with a
sense of the big picture. It is also essential to note that these goals should
be realistic so that your team don’t feel like you are functioning for a lost
cause. Having milestones and deadlines can give your team members opportunities
to help each other and band together for success.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Celebrate successes and
failures.</strong></li></ul>



<p>Bring
your team together when celebrating your successes and milestones. It allows
everyone to see and feel proud of themselves when they also are a part of the
success. If someone does a great job, give them a shout out in front of other
members of your team so that every effort is seen and appreciated. It also
helps each person to feel visible and that what they are doing has an impact.
In contrast, if your team fails at doing something, come together to redirect
your efforts or turn it into something positive. Don’t throw them under the bus
or turn a damage-control discussion into a blame game. It never helps anybody.
Instead, give your team members equal responsibility to put your heads together
and figure out the next steps or pivots.</p>



<p>As
an employer, you need to open all the possible doors for your employees.
Instead of running a dull business environment, you need to create an
encouraging work atmosphere with a positive group of individuals. </p>



<p>Developing your teams’ competencies has a lot of benefits, but watching your employees grow into their respective roles and develop their skills can be one of the most rewarding experiences in a career. </p>

<p> To know the need for money and to borrow wisely is a wise man doing in a start-up concern. To understand the need for money, and its leverages, in the long run. It is a necessity to be brief enough on the purchase of the capital.</p>



<p><strong>Not to borrow more than need</strong>.</p>



<p><br />Never to borrow more than need. Limit the demand and to borrow far less than the requirement. Leveraging the cash flow in the business will enable wise borrowings sense.</p>



<p><br /><strong>Choosing the borrowing Institution carefully.</strong></p>



<p><br />Never to borrow on high-Interest rates or from money lenders. Borrow wisely from a registered government banking sector. Comparing the various schemes available to choose the right repayment schedule with accordance with the money flow in the business.</p>



<p><br /><strong>Staying on guard with Loan sharks.</strong></p>



<p><br />Money is a product with the money lenders. Most of them will like to get maximum leverages for the money lent. We as <strong>placements consultancy in Bangalore </strong>have the human resources as our source of income for survival, and we do Charge for the services offered.</p>



<p>Lenders have tricky ways to mount the charges on borrowings on different styles like service charges and documentation charges, which are negotiable in many ways.</p>



<p>The overdraft limit sanctioned by bankers depending upon the securities pawned or repayment capacity of the Account holder. Interest is charged only for the money borrowed as repayment can be scheduled with the cash flow.</p>



<p><strong>Borrowing with calculation on repayments schedules.</strong></p>



<p><br />Repayment tenure depends on business to business with the cash flow and long term goals taken into account. On a personal note, we suggest short term borrowings that may cut the interest payments in the long run. A long term business plan needs planning with a focus in assets accumulation strategy.</p>



<p><strong>Monthly tract record on Payments and overheads.</strong></p>



<p><br />A wise businessperson will ensure productivity in all departments. Offloading any employee found unproductive is a continues to process in any concern seeking organic growth.<br />A luxurious lifestyle advisably avoided once borrowings have come into existence in the business. A smart businessperson will have a priority to close the lenders at the earliest to go on cash surplus status.<br />Purchases had to be on streamline with a focus on quality and pricing. Relationship with vendors will be on a positive status for a favourable paying term.</p>



<p>Systems in the business will be a periodic check-in for all departments, which are a recurring expense need constant checks and measures to curtail unwanted expenditures.</p>



<p><strong>Handling an Unforeseen situation</strong></p>



<p>There can be a situation where commitments can vary predictability.</p>



<ul><li>An Invoice payment can get postponed beyond the desired dates.</li><li>Business can get affected because of competition.</li><li> The flow of business can be slowed down with economic or untold reasons.</li><li>Seasonal changes in business may be a concern.</li><li>Technology is fast-changing with consumer awareness and expectations exceeding the past.</li><li>To withstand the timely situation with firmness and audacity is an entrepreneur born ability.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Family commitments while on business loan periods.</strong></p>



<p>Never to get sentimental when money matters. Tightening on a tight budget with all family commitments.</p>



<p>To be honest with family members of the situation in business and requesting their best assistance in curbing all unwanted expenditure while on a loan spree.</p>



<p>No business thrives without loans, and entrepreneurs dreams is a cash surplus staus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Only a smart connoisseur of gentlemen will be able to come out of the loan struggle unscathed as a victorious businessperson with the supporting family.&nbsp;<br /></p>

					<description><![CDATA[
Relationships in personal life are similar to an employee-employer bond. The connections are glued to stay for a longer time with a mutually beneficiary link.  ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em><strong>Start with good people, lay out the rules, communicate with your employees, motivate them and reward them. If you do all those things effectively, you can&#8217;t miss. </strong></em></p><cite> Lee Iacocca </cite></blockquote>



<p>Relationships in personal life are similar to an employee-employer bond. The connections are glued to stay for a longer time with a mutually beneficiary link.  </p>



<p>When matters get worsens in an unforeseen reason. The situation arises where the bond of the relationship had to get sorted out. Both the parties involved has to make the break-up a smooth sail over.</p>



<p>An employee is responsible for making the situation of firing an employer in tranquilness and gracefulness. An employee gets hired for unleashing his potential in the concern. </p>



<p>An employee-employer bond strives to last for a longterm. Reasons unforeseen can curtail the obligation for a split-off. The employer takes on the situation to make the occasion more gracefull like a split off in marriage where both the parties involved gracefully handle the separation.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong><em> Employee loyalty begins with employer loyalty. Your employees should know that if they do the job they were hired to do with a reasonable amount of competence and efficiency, you will support them. </em></strong></p><cite> Harvey Mackay<br /></cite></blockquote>



<p><strong>Points to be noted on in execution of a termination notice to an employee.</strong></p>



<p>The idea of termination can vary from workforce reduction or non-performance of an employee. The employer needs to summarize in detail and honesty the reasons for the split-off. In his termination order, the employer needs to mention the grounds on which the decision of termination got executed. </p>



<p>The reasons for split off can be the faulty employee who had committed a poor performance or an act of negligence. If so ever, the employee is defaulting in performance in given tasks. The procedures of dismissal have to be graceful, and no signs of humiliation will get seen in the eyes of the terminated employee.</p>



<p>Terminating an employee is a stressful job for any employer. The employer is overpowered to undertake the task out of interest of the concern on so many reasons.</p>



<h4><strong>The Six golden rules to adopt in firing an employee gracefully.</strong></h4>



<ul><li>Reasons for the split off to be in detail in summary.</li><li>A notice period for an employee on his termination order. No rooms for a surprise exit.</li><li>Clarity while hiring and transparency while firing is the rule book in termination of an employee.</li><li>Transparency in communications and a witness to the face to face talks will aid in unnecessary disputes on a later date.</li><li>Legal aspects ascertained to safeguard the concerns reputations. A lawsuit by the terminated employee will puncture the concern&#8217;s goodwill in the job market.</li><li>To put an end to the gossips in the workplace. A clearcut picture of the scenario showcased to the colleagues. The exit plan of the employee will be transparent in the workplace so not create a panic situation among the others with a clarity that caused the termination.</li></ul>



<p>A step ahead in assisting the exited employee in getting a job with providing the need full papers will be a gentle note of thanking for the services rendered so far.</p>



<p>A humane approach will always get appreciated by the exiting employee who is affected by a sick note.</p>



<p>Any further delay in termination of any employee found unproductive will leave a scar in the growth of a concern.</p>



<p>Procrastination of the termination of a non-performing employee will hit the stale end of the accounts in a longer run.</p>



<p>The concern needs to be on a firm note. After taking a resolution in the terminus of an employee.With no rooms for a discussion for a plea by the affected person.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most of the business concern has a policy of not recruiting any ex-employee one more time as they will be a spoilsport with the existing employees.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong><em>We invest very heavily in the employees. We get the return, and the employee gets the return if they stay with us for a while. So, we focus on people that will commit to us for the long run. </em></strong></p><cite><strong> Aneel Bhusri </strong></cite></blockquote>
